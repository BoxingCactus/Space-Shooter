# Space-Shooter

This is simply my space shooter fever dream of a project.

The goal is for you to pilot the robocat to destroy the non moving targets that are just sitting there waiting to be destroyed by the robocats SAL-missiles. Its all for practice for the real thing! You want to destroy them as quickly as possible, but there is technically no time limit, but you can always use the integrity system and brag to your friends how you have the quickest time on this random side project. My shortest time out of the final test runs, was around 3.8 seconds. If you can beat that, good on ya! Good luck aspiring robocat pilot!
